Works as follows:
1. Send a textmessage to a google voice number.
2. Android polls for new sms messages, dumps into a sqlite db.
3. Android uses text to speech to speak the sms message.
4. LEDControlActivity allows the android device to switch modes on the LED matrix boards over bluetooth.


Parts:
2 Arduino Unos
6 RGBMatrix boards with backpack (tried seven, but was having power issues) from sparkfun.
1 Bluesmirf Bluetooth modem.

Arduino code probably shouldn't be reused. It's pretty rough and I would only use it for reference.  The RGBMatrix arduino library was modified to allow the use of numbers, so you'll want add numbers to the RGB.h file. http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/201

Android code still has some bugs (memory leaks, sqlite code isn't the best, etc), but is pretty stable.  The google voice java library was tweaked a bit (theres no need to store a username/password, just get the auth token) so it is included in the code.

Please note that text to speech on android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwhich) and above will need text to speech modified as noted here: http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/10/ics-and-non-public-apis.html
